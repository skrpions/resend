for February 21st, 2024","slug":"incident-report-for-february-21-2024","description":"Detailed postmortem of the outage on February 21st.","image":"/static/posts/incident-report-for-february-21-2024.jpg","date":"2024-02-22","author_name":"Bu Kinoshita","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/bu-kinoshita.jpg","content":"\n## Summary (TL;DR)\n\nOn February 21st, 2024, Resend experienced an [outage](https://resend-status.com/incident/329826) that affected all users due to a database migration that went wrong. This prevented users from using the API (including sending emails) and accessing the dashboard from 05:01 to 17:05 UTC (about 12 hours).\n\nThe database migration accidentally deleted data from production servers. We immediately began the restoration process from a backup, which completed 6 hours later. Unfortunately, once it finished, we found that it failed to restore the data, so we had to start the restoration process a second time with a different backup.\n\nDuring this time, no API requests were being accepted and no data being stored. For data created prior to the migration, there was 5 minute of data loss from when the migration started and the database went offline from 04:50:00 to 04:56:27 UTC. We are currently working on re-populating the data from this 5-minute window.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact and inconvenience caused by this outage. We place immense importance on reliability, but this week, we fell short of our commitment to you all. It is clear that we have a long way to go in becoming an industry-leading infrastructure provider, but in learning from this incident, we will improve our operations and tooling to avoid outages like this in the future, whatever the cause.\n\n## Timeline\n\n*All times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)*\n\n**February 21st, 2024**\n\n* 04:56: Database migration started\n* 04:57: Noticed tables being dropped from the production database\n* 05:01: Began restoring the database from a backup\n* 05:02: Posted on [status page](https://resend-status.com/incident/329826), updating every 30-60 minutes until resolution\n* 11:02: First restoration process completed\n* 11:03: Realized the first backup failed and started to investigate\n* 11:33: Found that the backup failed due to a wrong selection of the backup timestamp\n* 11:48: Increased compute to speed up the restoration process - updated database memory from 128GB to 256GB and CPU from 32-core ARM to 64-core ARM\n* 12:05: Began restoring the database from an older backup\n* 17:01: Second restoration process completed\n* 17:02: API began receiving requests\n* 17:05: Dashboard was accessible again, and incident was resolved\n\n## What happened\n\nWhile building a feature, we performed a database migration command locally, but it incorrectly pointed to the production environment instead, which dropped all tables in production.\n\nThe first attempt to restore the database took 6 hours but failed due to a wrong selection of the backup timestamp. The second attempt to restore took an extra 5 hours and succeeded, bringing all data back besides a 5-minute window of data loss.\n\n## Impact\n\nAll users were unable to send emails, use the API, or access the Resend dashboard for 12 hours from 05:01 to 17:05 UTC.\n\nFor data created prior to the migration, there was 5 minutes of data loss from when the migration started and the database went offline from 04:50:00 to 04:56:27 UTC.\n\n## Next steps and improvements\n\n* Re-populate data from the 5-minute window of data loss.\n* No accessible user role should have write privileges on the production database.\n* Improve local development to reduce risks related to database migrations.\n* Create redundancy to preserve sending function even during a database outage.\n\n* Increase cadence for disaster recovery tests.\n* Implement incident banner on Resend dashboard to inform users quickly.\n\nTo our customers, we are deeply sorry that this incident occurred and that it prevented you from delivering your mission-critical emails. We know that actions speak louder than words, so we will continue to learn, grow, and improve, starting by implementing the improvements listed above.\n"},{"title":"Resend Forward: Wrap Up","slug":"resend-forward-wrap-up","description":"All about the new features we launched last week.","image":"/static/posts/resend-forward-wrap-up.jpg","date":"2024-01-22","author_name":"Zeno Rocha","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/zeno-rocha.jpg","content":"\nToday marks the end of [Resend Forward](/forward), our second launch week.\n\nIn the last seven days, we shipped six new features.\n\nHere's a quick recap of what we launched:\n\n- [Day 1: Send Marketing Emails with Resend Broadcasts](#day-1)\n- [Day 2: Manage subscribers with Resend Audiences](#day-2)\n- [Day 3: Improving Time to Inbox in Asia](#day-3)\n- [Day 4: Introducing the Batch Emails API](#day-4)\n- [Day 5: React Email 2.0](#day-5)\n- [Day 6: Introducing Light Mode](#day-6)\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"day-1\"\u003eDay 1: Send Marketing Emails with Resend Broadcasts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cvideo\n  src=\"/static/posts/send-marketing-emails-with-resend-broadcasts-3.mp4\"\n  autoplay\n  loop\n  muted\n  playsinline\n  class=\"extraWidth\" /\u003e\n\nOn Monday, we expanded Resend from being an email API to a no-code tool for technical and non-technical team members to engage with their audience.\n\nBroadcasts are designed to help you send email blasts using our WYSIWYG editor, with extensive inbox support out-of-the-box thanks to [React Email](https://react.email).\n\nIt also comes with email testing, markdown support, performance tracking, and 1,000 contacts for free.\n\n- **Read the [announcement](/blog/send-marketing-emails-with-resend-broadcasts)**\n- **Go to the [dashboard](https://resend.com/broadcasts)**\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"day-2\"\u003eDay 2: Manage subscribers with Resend Audiences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cimg \n  src=\"/static/posts/manage-subscribers-using-resend-audiences-1.png\" \n  alt=\"Resend Audiences\" \n  class=\"extraWidth\"\n/\u003e\n\nOn Tuesday, we announced a new way to manage recipients.\n\nAudiences allows you to add, update, retrieve, and remove contacts without having to worry about the entire unsubscribe flow.

That's why we want to respect everyone's preferences.\n\n## How did we take our brand from dark to light mode?\n\nOur brand identity hasn't changed; we still predominantly use dark colors in our communication assets. What we did was expand our dashboard to include light mode, primarily for accessibility purposes.\n\nHowever, all marketing communications, landing pages, and public pages will continue to use our original, dark brand colors exclusively.\n\n## How did we implement this into our product?\n\nThis wasn't a one-to-one conversion from black to white. We began by conducting color experiments in Figma to understand what works and what doesn't.\n\nWhen designing for a light background, many colors had their lightness and saturation adjusted to ensure legibility. We also had to consider the contrast ratio between the background and foreground colors.\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"Light/dark mode color palette\" src=\"/static/posts/introducing-light-mode-2.png\" class=\"extraWidth\"\u003e\n\nThe tech stack facilitated this transition a lot. By relying on [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), we accommodated approximately 70% of our needs by importing Radix colors as CSS variables and incorporating these values into our Tailwind configuration.\n\n```js\n@import '@radix-ui/colors/slate-alpha.css';\n@import '@radix-ui/colors/slate-dark-alpha.css';\n```\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n\t\tcolors: {\n\t\t\tslate: {\n\t\t\t\t  1: 'var(--slate-a1)',\n\t\t\t\t  2: 'var(--slate-a2)',\n\t\t\t\t  3: 'var(--slate-a3)',\n...\n```\n\nFor the animated icons powered by [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/), we used a trick to invert the existing icons with the CSS rule `filter:invert(1)` to avoid generating new JSON files for each color.\n\nWe then started fine-tuning colors and other elements using Tailwind. For example, in light mode, the sidebar has a background color, but not in the dark mode. To achieve that, we used the `dark:` variant from Tailwind.\n\n## How about the documentation?\n\nThanks to [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com), we could implement light mode for our docs with a few lines of code.\n\nYou can find the new theme toggle on the top right corner of the [documentation page](/docs).\n\n\u003cimg \n\tsrc=\"/static/posts/introducing-light-mode-3.png\" \n\talt=\"Documentation with light mode\" \n\tclass=\"extraWidth\"\n/\u003e\n\n## Get Started\n\nBy default, dark mode is on, but now you have the option to switch the theme to light mode when it suits for you.\n\nVisit the [Resend Dashboard](/overview) today and press `M` enable light mode.\n"},{"title":"React Email 2.0","slug":"react-email-2","description":"Our mission to create the best developer experience for email continues with a new major version.","image":"/static/posts/react-email-2.jpg","date":"2024-01-19","author_name":"Gabriel Miranda","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/gabriel-miranda.jpg","content":"\nWe're excited to introduce React Email 2.0, featuring:\n\n- **[Re-imagined preview experience](#re-imagined-preview-experience)**\n- **[Massive performance improvements](#massive-performance-improvements)**\n- **[New components](#new-components)**\n- **[Deployment to Vercel](#deployment-to-vercel)**\n- **[Better support for monorepos](#better-support-for-monorepos)**\n\nUpdate today and check the [upgrade instructions](#upgrade-instructions) below.\n\n```sh\nnpm i react-email@latest\n```\n\nReact Email has now **114,583 weekly downloads** on npm, and **10,924 stars** on GitHub.

It's what makes the feedback cycle much faster, and the developer experience much better. That's why we decided to re-imagine it from the ground up.\n\n**New mobile preview**\n\nYou can now see how your emails will look like on a small screen without having to resize the browser window or open the DevTools.\n\n\u003cvideo\n  src=\"/static/posts/react-email-2-1.mp4\"\n  autoplay\n  loop\n  muted\n  playsinline\n  onClick=\"this.controls = true\"\n  class=\"extraWidth\"\n/\u003e\n\n**Revamped file tree**\n\nThe file tree now supports subdirectories, so you can organize your emails however you want.

The new version, took, at most, only **~7s**.\n\nOnce the initial setup is done, you should see much faster boot up times around **~1s**.\n\n![~40s before and now ~7s](/static/posts/react-email-2-5.jpg)\n\nThe tests were run on a Linux machine with a 3.6 GHz 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 4500 CPU, 16 GB 3600 MHz DDR4 memory, and a download speed of about 114 mbit/s.\n\nThese tests were made considering the first experience the user would have by deleting both the `.react-email` and `.next` folders.\n\nLess time waiting for downloads and installs, means more time doing the actual work.\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"new-components\"\u003eNew components\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nOne thing we've always hated is seeing code displayed as an image instead of actual text. It's not only annoying, but it's also not accessible. You can't copy the code, and you can't search for it.\n\nWhen it comes to email, we've seen this happen a lot. That's why we decided to add new components to React Email to make it easier to display code in your emails.\n\n**Code Block**\n\nWith the new [code-block](https://react.email/docs/components/code-block) component, you can render code with a selected theme and syntax highlight powered by Prism.js.\n\n```jsx\nimport { CodeBlock, dracula } from '@react-email/components';\n\nconst Email = () =\u003e {\n  const code = `{\n max-width: 80vh;\n width: 100%;\n}`;\n\n  return \u003cCodeBlock code={code} lineNumbers theme={dracula} language=\"css\" /\u003e;\n};\n```\n\n![Code Block Example](/static/posts/react-email-2-6.png)\n\n**Inline Code**\n\nAnd with the new [code-inline](https://react.email/docs/components/code-inline) component, you can display a predictable inline code HTML element that works on all email clients.\n\n```jsx\nimport { CodeInline } from '@react-email/components';\n\nconst Email = () =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Use \u003cCodeInline\u003etransform\u003c/CodeInline\u003e and{' '}\n      \u003cCodeInline\u003eopacity\u003c/CodeInline\u003e in CSS for 60fps animations.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n  );\n};\n```\n\n![Code Inline Example](/static/posts/react-email-2-7.png)\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"deployment-to-vercel\"\u003eDeployment to Vercel and others\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nSomething that we really needed ourselves was being able to deploy the React Email preview directly to Vercel, and now we have been able to do so.\n\nThis new version makes it so much more easier to deploy, not only to Vercel but any cloud provider, when compared to the previous version.\n\nHere are the steps to deploy your React Email app to Vercel:\n\n1. Add \"build\" script to `./package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"email build\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Change \"Framework Preset\" on Vercel's project settings to Next.js\n\n3. Change \"Output Directory\" to `.react-email/.next`\n\nIn the end, your settings should look like this:\n\n![Vercel configuration for React Email](/static/posts/react-email-2-8.png)\n\nThis will enable deployments to both production and preview URLs.\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"better-support-for-monorepos\"\u003eBetter support for monorepos\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nReact Email is now compatible with turborepo, npm, bun, pnpm, and yarn workspaces.\n\nNo more downloads, no more package manager installation hell.\n\nTo fix this, we now run esbuild on the emails. This allows for bundling which will bring along your installed dependencies, making the behavior for rendering much more predictable. It also means that if you are using code from other packages on your monorepo, it will bring it along into the preview without any hastle.\n\n![turbo / npm / bun / pnpm / yarn](/static/posts/react-email-2-9.jpg)\n\nBefore we would have the preview client on our repo, and then we would download it based on a tag for its version. Now, once you install the CLI globally it will come along with the preview client out-of-the-box.\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"upgrade-instructions\"\u003eUpgrade instructions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n1. Update your `react-email` package to `2.0.0`.\n\n```sh\nnpm i react-email@latest\n```\n\n2. Update your `@react-email/components` package to `0.0.14`.\n\n```sh\nnpm i @react-email/components@latest\n```\n\nYou can also check if you have any missing dependencies for your emails to be bundled.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want to know all details about this release, check the [React Email Changelog](https://react.email/docs/changelog).\n\nIf you have any problems upgrading, feel free to share on [GitHub](https://github.com/resend/react-email), [Discord](https://resend.com/discord) or [X](https://x.com/resend).\n"},{"title":"Introducing the Batch Emails API","slug":"introducing-the-batch-emails-api","description":"Process a high volume of emails at once with the new bulk endpoint.","image":"/static/posts/introducing-the-batch-emails-api.jpg","date":"2024-01-18","author_name":"Vitor Capretz","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/vitor-capretz.jpg","content":"\nToday, we're reaching GA for Batch Emails.

So, we wanted to make it simple for them to do so without having to write custom code, hit the rate limit, or use a third-party service.\n\nBefore, you would need to set up a queueing system to make that work. Now, we handle all the infrastructure and orchestration complexity so you can focus on your product.\n\n![Queue System Architecture](/static/posts/introducing-the-batch-emails-api-1.png)\n\n## Sending Batch Emails\n\nYou can use the various Resend SDKs, including [Python](https://github.com/resend/resend-python), [Ruby](https://github.com/resend/resend-ruby), [PHP](https://github.com/resend/resend-php), [Go](https://github.com/resend/resend-go), and [Java](https://github.com/resend/resend-java) to send batch emails.\n\nHere's an example using the [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/resend/resend-node):\n\n```ts\nimport { Resend } from 'resend';\n\nconst resend = new Resend('re_123456789');\n\nconst data = await resend.batch.send([\n  {\n    from: 'Acme \u003conboarding@resend.dev\u003e',\n    to: ['foo@gmail.com'],\n    subject: 'hello world',\n    html: '\u003ch1\u003eit works!\u003c/h1\u003e',\n  },\n  {\n    from: 'Acme \u003conboarding@resend.dev\u003e',\n    to: ['bar@outlook.com'],\n    subject: 'world hello',\n    html: '\u003cp\u003eit works!\u003c/p\u003e',\n  },\n]);\n```\n\nThe REST endpoint is available at `POST /emails/batch`, and it accepts an array of emails.\n\nYou can check the [Resend OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/resend/resend-openapi) or the [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/resend/workspace/resend-api/collection/78558-536fcef8-4f87-42a5-ae1a-57f891ef1404) for all parameters.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/emails/batch' \\\n     -H 'Authorization: Bearer re_123456789' \\\n     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n     -d $'[\n  {\n    \"from\": \"Acme \u003conboarding@resend.dev\u003e\",\n    \"to\": [\"foo@gmail.com\"],\n    \"subject\": \"hello world\",\n    \"html\": \"\u003ch1\u003eit works!\u003c/h1\u003e\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"from\": \"Acme \u003conboarding@resend.dev\u003e\",\n    \"to\": [\"bar@outlook.com\"],\n    \"subject\": \"world hello\",\n    \"html\": \"\u003cp\u003eit works!\u003c/p\u003e\"\n  }\n]'\n```\n\nNote that the `attachments` and `tags` fields are not supported yet.\n\n## Get started\n\nWe hope this new endpoint makes it easier for you to send emails to multiple recipients, all while ensuring that every message is delivered to each contact individually.\n\nKeep in mind that the number of emails you can send in a single batch (currently 100) is customizable, so if you have specific needs, please [contact support](/contact).\n\nYou can check the [documentation](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-batch-emails) for more details.\n"},{"title":"Improving Time to Inbox in Asia","slug":"improving-time-to-inbox-in-asia","description":"We're excited to announce more efficient sending support for Asia users.","image":"/static/posts/improving-time-to-inbox-in-asia.jpg","date":"2024-01-17","author_name":"Krithika Yetchina","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/krithika-yetchina.jpg","content":"\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of our new **Tokyo region**, bringing faster and more reliable time to inbox to our customers in Asia.\n\nThis addition complements our existing regions in **Europe (Ireland)**, **South America (Brazil)**, and **North America (US)**.\n\nWith the Tokyo region, customers can now choose the nearest server location for optimized email sending. This means that no matter where your users are, you can be assured that they receive your emails in an efficient manner.\n\nHere's how you can visualize the different regions in the Resend dashboard:\n\n\u003cimg \n    src=\"/static/posts/improving-time-to-inbox-in-asia-1.png\" \n    alt=\"List of domains on each region\" \n    class=\"extraWidth\"\n  /\u003e\n\n## Why is this important?\n\nEspecially for transactional emails like magic links, password resets, and welcome messages, users expect to receive them right away. If they don't, they might not be able to access your service right away, which could be a missed opportunity for your organization.\n\nHere are some of the other benefits of using our multi-region email sending feature:\n\n1. **Faster delivery:** By sending emails from the region closest to your user, you can reduce latency and ensure a faster time-to-inbox. This can be the difference between people using/buying your product or not.\n2. **Easier account management:** Instead of having to maintain different accounts for each region, we're providing multi-region within the same account. That way, you aren't juggling different login credentials.\n3. **Increased resilience:** In case of disruption in one region, our multi-region feature enables you to send emails from a backup domain in a separate region, guaranteeing maximum uptime.\n\n## How to use it\n\nEach domain in Resend must specificy a region upon creation. To start using our Tokyo region email sending, go to [Domains](/domains), and choose the option to add a new domain. Then, select the Tokyo region from the drop down.\n\n\u003cimg \n    src=\"/static/posts/improving-time-to-inbox-in-asia-2.png\" \n    alt=\"Select a region when adding a domain\" \n    class=\"extraWidth\"\n  /\u003e\n\n## How about data residency?\n\nWe understand that there's an increasing complexity around data processing due to different privacy laws.

No user action is required to continue safely sending.**\n\nWe have since closed the access and rotated all database keys. Additionally, we are partnering with third-party cybersecurity company, [Oneleet](https://www.oneleet.com/), to conduct an exhaustive investigation and help us ensure this attack cannot occur again.\n\nWe are deeply sorry for the impact this had on our users. We remain committed to transparency and prevention. The following is a summary of what went wrong, how the incident was resolved, and the work we are doing to ensure it does not happen again.\n\n## Incident timeline\n\nAll timestamps referenced are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\n- On December 30th, at 11:20 pm, the attackers first gained access to our system by discovering an exposed database API key as an environment variable on the client-side of the Resend Dashboard.\n- On December 31st, at 12:28 pm, a Resend team member discovered that multiple users were sharing the same billing information. This appeared to be a strange bug and did not raise enough of a red flag during the holiday weekend for further investigation. An alarm was put in place to make sure this didn't happen to other users.\n- On January 7th, at 7:28 pm, the attacker started accessing data.\n- On January 9th, at 4:47 am, a user was discovered to have unblocked email sending on their account. During normal operations, senders are blocked for not complying with our Acceptable Use Policy. One of these users was able to update fields normally not accessible to users in order to unblock their sending. With further investigation, it appears they had already done this three times.\n- On January 9th, at 4:59 am, this incident was promoted to SEV-0 internally. We understood this attack to be a form of hijacking of an existing API request, not accessing the database.\n- On January 9th, at 5:21 pm, logs were discovered showing GET, PATCH, and DELETE requests to the database, making it clear that the database API layer had been accessed, but not clear the full exposure.\n- On January 9th, at 11:01 pm, logs were discovered showing programmatic access of database tables, which allowed us to establish the method, extent, and severity of the access. Our audit of the entire database leads us to be confident that we know the impact of the incident and have comprehensive knowledge of what happened and what steps we need to take to remediate this.\n- On January 10, at 2:32 am, the remediation was deployed to production.\n- On January 10, at 3:21 am, the database credentials were rotated, causing a 25 minute downtime.\n\n## How this affects you\n\nNo user action is required to continue safely sending. You may consider consulting an attorney regarding data privacy implications in your jurisdiction.\n\nIf you need an export of your data, please contact us at [security@resend.com](mailto:security@resend.com).\n\nHere is a comprehensive list of what data was impacted. Only data after November 1st, 2023 was accessed.\n\n**Emails Sent**\n\n- Accessed: Recipient address, sender address, sent date, subject, bcc, cc, reply to, and last event.\n- Not Accessed: No email content body which includes the HTML/plain text, and attachments.\n\n**Domains**\n\n- Accessed: Domain names, verification status, region, and DKIM public keys.\n- Not Accessed: No unencrypted DKIM private keys.\n\n**API Keys**\n\n- Accessed: Names, permission roles, and encrypted tokens.\n- Not Accessed: No unencrypted tokens.\n\n**Logs**\n\n- Accessed: HTTP Response data such as status code, and HTTP Request data such as method, and endpoint.\n- Not Accessed: No HTTP Response JSON body, and Request JSON body, or headers.\n\n**Contacts**\n\n- Accessed: Email addresses and names.\n\n**Users**\n\n- Accessed: Resend user email addresses.\n- Not Accessed: No Resend user names or passwords.\n\n## Actions and remediations\n\nThese are the preventative measures that we have **already taken**:\n\n1. Removed database API environment variable from the client-side of the Resend Dashboard.\n2. Rotated database API access keys.\n3. Enforced MFA across all systems touching the database.\n4. Conducted org-wide password reset across all systems touching the database.\n\nThese are the preventative measures that we **will be taking immediately**:\n\n1. Improving monitoring and alerting for database API access.\n2. Partnering with a third-party cybersecurity company, Oneleet, to conduct an exhaustive investigation.\n\nPlease reach out to us at [security@resend.com](mailto:security@resend.com) if you have any questions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe sincerely apologize to everyone affected by this incident, and we appreciate your understanding as we learn to navigate this challenging period.\n\nThis has been an unfortunate and trying moment for us, but solidified the determination and commitment of each and every team member at Resend.\n\nYour trust is what has built us, and we remain deeply committed to ensuring your sending is safe.\n"},{"title":"Gmail and Yahoo’s bulk sending requirements for 2024","slug":"gmail-and-yahoo-bulk-sending-requirements-for-2024","description":"Starting February 2024, Gmail and Yahoo will be enforcing new bulk sending requirements.","image":"/static/posts/gmail-and-yahoo-bulk-sending-requirements-for-2024-cover.jpg","date":"2024-01-09","author_name":"Rafael Viana","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/rafael-viana.jpg","content":"\nBoth [Gmail](https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/) and [Yahoo](https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/) have revamped their bulk sending requirements. The new guidelines are scheduled to start being enforced as of February 2024 and are specifically targeted towards bulk senders, which Gmail defines as anyone sending 5,000 emails a day.\n\nThese updates are driven by Gmail and Yahoo Mail emphasizing sender responsibility when it comes to user protection and brand integrity. Many of their users are receiving upwards of 95% spam, and they are looking to reduce this number.\n\nThese guidelines are particularly pertinent to marketing and promotional emails, while transactional messages like account notifications or password resets generally don’t fall under this classification.\n\nBreaking down these updates, here are the important changes:\n\n- **[One-Click Unsubscribe](#one-click-unsubscribe)**\n- **[Email Authentication with DMARC](#email-authentication-with-dmarc)**\n- **[Keep Spam Complaint Rates Below 0.3%](#keep-spam-complaint-rates-below-zero-point-three-percent)**\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"one-click-unsubscribe\"\u003eOne-Click Unsubscribe\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nThe list-unsubscribe header, rooted in [RFC 2369](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2369) and refined by [RFC 8058](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058), introduced a one-click mechanism, ignored by anti-spam crawlers, that simplifies opting out for users.\n\nAs of February 2024, your bulk messages must include a URL version in your list-unsubscribe header.\n\nThis header allows email clients to offer an easy “Unsubscribe” option in their UI, enhancing the user experience and spam complaints.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/gmail-and-yahoo-bulk-sending-requirements-for-2024-1.png\" alt=\"Gmail One-Click Unsubscribe\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eGmail One-Click Unsubscribe\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nOnce the user clicks the button, the email client will display a confirmation popup.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/gmail-and-yahoo-bulk-sending-requirements-for-2024-2.png\" alt=\"Gmail One-Click Unsubscribe Confirmation\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eGmail One-Click Unsubscribe Confirmation\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nIn order to achieve true one-click functionality:\n\n**1) Add unsubscribe headers to your email headers**\n\nThis allows that the unsubscribe action is initiated by the email client.\n\n```sh\nList-Unsubscribe: \u003chttps://example.com/unsubscribe\u003e\nList-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click\n```\n\n**2) When receiving a `POST` request with the key-pair above**\n\nReturn a blank page with a **200 (OK)** or **202 (Accepted)**\n\n**3) Show the regular unsubscribe page on `GET` method**\n\nIt’s also a good idea to incorporate a unique identifier in your list-unsubscribe requests, linked to the message ID, to track user interactions without sharing personal data.\n\nProcessing unsubscribe requests immediately shows proactive effort to honor user preferences beyond Google and Yahoo's two-day guideline.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n\n- Add \"**List-Unsubscribe**\" header to your email headers\n- Add \"**List-Unsubscribe-Post**\" header to your email headers\n\n_Note: both of these headers are handled automatically when using Resend Broadcasts. No action is needed from you._\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"email-authentication-with-dmarc\"\u003eEmail Authentication with DMARC\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nGmail and Yahoo now demand [DMARC](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/dmarc) alongside SPF and DKIM. This trio strengthens email security and allows receiving servers confidently verify your legitimacy, not just protect from spoofing and phishing.\n\nDKIM and SPF are already taken care of by Resend, and DMARC is now crucial. Start with a \"**none**\" policy to gather insights from DMARC reports (rua/ruf tags) and then troubleshoot non-compliant sending so you can move your domain to a \"**strict**\" policy.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n\n- Setup [DMARC](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/dmarc) on your sending domains\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"keep-spam-complaint-rates-below-zero-point-three-percent\"\u003eKeep Spam Complaint Rates Below 0.3%\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nGmail and Yahoo's latest updates call for improved list management by bulk senders, focusing on emails that recipients want. Both providers want senders to closely monitor spam complaints, a key metric in identifying undesirable emails for their filtering algorithms.\n\nThe magic complaint number is **0.3%** and anything above this is consider unacceptable to Gmail and Yahoo. Complaints can be monitored via the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/overview) or through Postmaster tools of the inbox provider. Resend also offers a webhook to notify on complaints ([code example](https://github.com/resend/resend-examples/tree/main/with-webhooks)).\n\n**Next Steps**:\n\n- Maintain complaint rates under **0.3%**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGmail and Yahoo Mail updates in 2024 prioritize improved email authentication and compliance, making SPF, DKIM, and now DMARC, essential for maintaining email integrity and trust. SPF and DKIM are handled by default by Resend. Be sure you checkout our [guide for DMARC](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/dmarc).\n\nFor bulk senders: implement [one-click unsubscribe](https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/how-do-i-add-an-unsubscribe-link-to-my-emails), keep spam rates under 0.3%. Track spam with Google Postmaster Tools; Yahoo complaints can be monitored via Resend dashboard or notified via [webhook](https://github.com/resend/resend-examples/tree/main/with-webhooks).\n"},{"title":"Improved Performance for Tailwind Emails","slug":"improved-performance-for-tailwind-emails","description":"How we reduced render times for emails using Tailwind to be 23x faster.","date":"2023-12-06","image":"/static/posts/improved-performance-for-tailwind-emails.jpg","author_name":"Gabriel Miranda","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/gabriel-miranda.jpg","content":"\nWhen we started [react.email](https://react.email/docs/introduction), the idea was to make modern web development tooling, like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), available for the email ecosystem.\n\nBut for some time, the `\u003cTailwind /\u003e` component had a few problems, leading users to go back into using inline styles. This is not the experience we wanted for developers.\n\nThat's why we're excited to announce a major performance improvement. The render time for Tailwind emails is now **23x** faster.\n\n![~3681ms before and now 156ms](/static/posts/improved-performance-for-tailwind-emails-numbers.jpg)\n\n\u003csmall style=\"font-size:12px;text-align:center;width:100%;display:block\"\u003eThese are numbers from \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/main/benchmarks/tailwind-component\"\u003ebenchmarks\u003c/a\u003e on real-world \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/resend/react-email/blob/main/benchmarks/tailwind-component/src/emails/with-tailwind.tsx\"\u003eemail templates\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/small\u003e\n\n## Benchmark Results\n\nWe used the [Tinybench](https://github.com/tinylibs/tinybench) library to run the tests. The tests were run on a Linux machine with a 3.6 GHz 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 4500 CPU and 16 GB 3600 MHz DDR4 memory.\n\nThe sample size was 100 email renders for each test, and the [same email template](https://github.com/resend/react-email/blob/main/benchmarks/tailwind-component/src/emails/with-tailwind.tsx) was used for all the tests. The results are in nanoseconds per operation.\n\n```\n┌─────────┬───────────┬─────────┬────────────────────┬──────────┬─────────┐\n│ (index) │ Task Name │ ops/sec │ Average Time (ns)  │  Margin  │ Samples │\n├─────────┼───────────┼─────────┼────────────────────┼──────────┼─────────┤\n│    0    │  after    │    8    │ 120386175.23986846 │  ±2.07%  │   100   │\n│    1    │  before   │    0    │ 3326383692.750111  │  ±0.72%  │   100   │\n└─────────┴───────────┴─────────┴────────────────────┴──────────┴─────────┘\n```\n\nHere are the results **before** the performance improvements:\n\n- **p75**: 3385ms\n- **p99**: 3681ms\n\nAnd here are the results **after** the performance improvements:\n\n- **p75**: 126ms\n- **p99**: 156ms\n\nWe can see that the p99 is **23x** faster, and the p75 is **26x** faster.\n\n## What changed\n\nThe greatest point of performance degradation that we had before was with the way we ran Tailwind to generate the styles for classes. Every time the component would come across a `className`, it would start `tailwind` alongside `postcss`, which was unnecessary.\n\nTo fix this, we changed the component to render the whole React element tree. Then, we ran Tailwind on it to know which inline styles to substitute for each class name.\n\nWe then created a map of the inline styles associated with the class names as _keys_. After that, we added these inline styles from the map to each element that uses these class names. This means the second traversal grows **linearly** instead of **exponentially**.\n\n## Upgrading to the new version\n\n**1. Upgrade package versions**\n\nIf you are importing the Tailwind component from `@react-email/components` you can update it to version `0.0.12`.\n\n```sh\nnpm i @react-email/components@0.0.12\n```\n\nOr if you are importing it directly from `@react-email/tailwind` you can update it to version `0.0.13`.\n\n```sh\nnpm i @react-email/tailwind@0.0.13\n```\n\n**2. Change component order if you use media queries**\n\nIf you are using Tailwind classes that renders into media queries like dark mode, you'll have to change the order in which the components are defined.\n\nYou need to move the Tailwind component from wrapping the `\u003cHtml /\u003e` component followed by the `\u003cHead /\u003e` component to just directly wrapping the `\u003cHead /\u003e` component.\n\n```jsx\nconst Email = () =\u003e (\n  \u003cHtml\u003e\n    \u003cTailwind\u003e\n      \u003cHead /\u003e\n    \u003c/Tailwind\u003e\n  \u003c/Html\u003e\n);\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want to know more about this update, including technical details, and stability improvements, check the [React Email Changelog](https://react.email/docs/changelog).\n\nIf you have any problems upgrading, feel free to share on [GitHub](https://github.com/resend/react-email), [Discord](https://resend.com/discord) or [X](https://x.com/resend).\n"},{"title":"Welcoming Krithika Yetchina, our new Customer Support Engineer","slug":"welcoming-krithika-yetchina","description":"We're thrilled to share the news that Krithika Yetchina is joining Resend.","image":"/static/posts/welcoming-krithika-yetchina.jpg","date":"2023-11-22","author_name":"Jonni Lundy","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/jonni-lundy.jpg","content":"\nEverything we do has the goal of reducing friction for developers. We believe that Resend customers not only trust us with their emails but also with their time. That's why the entire team works on support tickets and customer issues.\n\nOver the past two months, twice as many developers have started using Resend than before. This poses major scaling dilemmas, and while we're implementing many operational improvements, we also know that nothing replaces the care and creativity of a person. That's why we're thrilled to announce that Krithika Yetchina is joining Resend as a Customer Support Engineer.\n\nKrithika has been helping developers for over 3 years at companies like Stacker and VIIZR. She's quick to show empathy, relentlessly curious about the root issue, and fearless in putting herself on the front line to help developers. We believe that with her help, Resend will continue to be the best email service for developers.\n\n## More about Krithika\n\n**How did you get into coding?**\n\nGrowing up, both my parents were engineers in big tech, but I was convinced that I would become a neurosurgeon. I bought all of the Grey’s Anatomy books and watched open heart surgeries on Youtube. Once I found out that becoming a doctor in the US could take 8+ years, I knew I had to figure something else out for myself. (I didn’t like school too much!) The company my mom worked for was hosting a hackathon, and she suggested that I go to check it out. Something about the high energy and creative space just clicked for me, and I knew it would be the start of a new hobby (and career path!).\n\n**Why are you at Resend?**\n\nI feel passionate about tools and products that save people time, energy, and headaches. When I learned more about Resend, and saw the feedback that users had about the efficiency that Resend brought to them, I knew that I was going to enjoy working with the team. The attention to detail, paired with the dedication that the team has to ensuring that their end users are delighted is why I am so excited to embark on this journey with them.\n\n**Where do you find #inspiration?**\n\nInspiration for me comes from my close friends and family. Everyone around me works so hard to follow their passions, dreams, and providing for their family and loved ones. I find that surrounding myself with individuals like these keeps me inspired to improve myself a little bit more everyday.\n\n**If you weren't helping developers, what would you be doing?**\n\nI would probably go into teaching and education for young adults in underserved communities, specifically in the tech space. I saw how having two parents create careers in technical spaces helped my family immensely, and I truly believe that the opportunities are just beginning.\n\n**What does your desktop screen look like?**\n\nUsually, I have a bunch of screenshots and files that flood my desktop, but I’m trying my absolute best to keep it as clean and minimal as possible.\n\n![Krithika's desktop](/static/posts/welcoming-krithika-yetchina-1.jpg)\n\n**Favorite tool?**\n\nMy favorite tool has to be TickTick. This tool helps me organize my entire life from my personal to-dos, work tasks, and even habits! I love that I can access all of my day to day from any device seamlessly.\n\n**Favorite hotkey?**\n\n`Command + Control + Shift + 4`: This lets me take a screenshot on a Macbook, and automatically copies it to my clipboard. I find that I send screenshots to friends, family, and coworkers quite often so this helps make it efficient.\n\n**Favorite place to visit?**\n\nThe grocery store! I love cooking for my friends and family, and I could spend endless hours browsing aisles, thinking of new recipes, and tinkering with unique ingredients. One thing I love doing when I travel out of the country is visiting supermarkets, and asking the staff what locals buy often, and then trying those new foods.\n\n**Advice for ambitious developer success engineers?**\n\nFind your “reason why”, and dig deep into it. In all honesty, programming and engineering didn’t click for me like I observed it did for my peers. I struggled in computer science classes, and was definitely feeling the impostor syndrome looming in my mind. What helped change my mindset and perspective was figuring out why I wanted to work with people and technology - I realized that I love helping people find tools, products, and automations that save them time and energy! It took me longer than I anticipated to find this motivation, so don’t beat yourself up if you’re feeling stuck or lost. It still happens to this day, but my “reason why” is what helps me get back on my path.\n"},{"title":"How to send emails using Bun","description":"Render emails server-side and send them crazy fast using Bun and React.","slug":"how-to-send-emails-using-bun","date":"2023-09-20","image":"/static/posts/send-emails-using-bun.jpg","author_name":"Vitor Capretz","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/vitor-capretz.jpg","content":"\n## What is Bun again?\n\n[Bun](https://bun.sh) is an all-in-one runtime for JavaScript. It comes with a bundler, test runner, and package manager.\n\nThe best thing about Bun is its speed. It's way faster than Node.js and Deno, which makes it pretty compelling for edge computing.\n\nSince lots of emails are sent via background jobs running in edge functions, we decided to explore how to send emails using Bun.\n\n## Starting the HTTP server\n\nTo get started, we will create an `index.tsx` file and include a simple HTTP server that returns a \"Hello World\" message.\n\n```tsx\nconst server = Bun.serve({\n  port: 3000,\n  fetch(request) {\n    return new Response('Hello World!');\n  },\n});\n\nconsole.log(`Listening on localhost:${server.port}`);\n```\n\nRun the local server by executing `bun index.tsx` on the terminal. Once you navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, you will see the message.\n\nNow that we have this foundation, we can add the actual email functionality.\n\n## Adding Resend for email sending\n\nFirst, we import the `resend` package and create a new client that will authenticate using an [Resend API key](https://resend.com/api-keys).\n\nThen, we call the `send` method and return the response object. In this example, we're sending an email using the `html` property.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Resend } from 'resend';\n\nconst resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);\n\nconst server = Bun.serve({\n  port: 3000,\n  async fetch() {\n    const data = await resend.emails.send({\n      from: 'Acme \u003conboarding@resend.dev\u003e',\n      to: ['delivered@resend.dev'],\n      subject: 'Hello World',\n      html: '\u003cp\u003eIt works!\u003c/p\u003e',\n    });\n\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data));\n  },\n});\n\nconsole.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${server.port} ...`);\n```\n\n## Integrating React Email templates\n\nBeing able to send an email using HTML is nice, but being able to use an engine like [React Email](https://react.email) is even better.\n\nTo make things interesting, let's create a new `waitlist-email.tsx` file that will render a beautiful waitlist email.\n\n```tsx\nimport {\n  Body,\n  Container,\n  Head,\n  Heading,\n  Html,\n  Preview,\n  Text,\n} from '@react-email/components';\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\ninterface WaitlistEmailProps {\n  name: string;\n}\n\nexport const WaitlistEmail = ({ name }: WaitlistEmailProps) =\u003e (\n  \u003cHtml\u003e\n    \u003cHead /\u003e\n    \u003cPreview\u003eThank you for joining our waitlist and for your patience\u003c/Preview\u003e\n    \u003cBody style={main}\u003e\n      \u003cContainer style={container}\u003e\n        \u003cHeading style={h1}\u003eComing Soon.\u003c/Heading\u003e\n        \u003cText style={text}\u003e\n          Thank you {name} for joining our waitlist and for your patience. We\n          will send you a note when we have something new to share.\n        \u003c/Text\u003e\n      \u003c/Container\u003e\n    \u003c/Body\u003e\n  \u003c/Html\u003e\n);\n\nconst main = {\n  backgroundColor: '#000000',\n  margin: '0 auto',\n};\n\nconst container = {\n  margin: 'auto',\n  padding: '96px 20px 64px',\n};\n\nconst h1 = {\n  color: '#ffffff',\n  fontSize: '24px',\n  fontWeight: '600',\n  lineHeight: '40px',\n  margin: '0 0 20px',\n};\n\nconst text = {\n  color: '#aaaaaa',\n  fontSize: '14px',\n  lineHeight: '24px',\n  margin: '0 0 40px',\n};\n```\n\nNow that we have this template, we can import it into our `index.tsx` file and use it to send an email.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Resend } from 'resend';\nimport { WaitlistEmail } from './waitlist-email';\n\nconst resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);\n\nconst server = Bun.serve({\n  port: 3000,\n  async fetch() {\n    const data = await resend.emails.send({\n      from: 'Acme \u003conboarding@resend.dev\u003e',\n      to: ['delivered@resend.dev'],\n      subject: 'Hello from Bun + Resend + React Email 🫓💌',\n      react: WaitlistEmail({ name: 'Vitor' }),\n    });\n\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data));\n  },\n});\n\nconsole.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${server.port} ...`);\n```\n\nBy running `bun index.tsx`, you should see the email being sent using React.\n\n## Learn more\n\nWe're excited to see what you build with Bun and Resend.\n\nIf you want to see the full code, you can check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/resend/resend-bun-example).\n"},{"title":"Welcoming Haison Ohara, our new Developer Success Engineer","slug":"welcoming-haison-ohara","description":"We're thrilled to share the news that Haison Ohara is joining Resend.","image":"/static/posts/welcoming-haison-ohara.jpg","date":"2023-09-14","author_name":"Jonni Lundy","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/jonni-lundy.jpg","content":"\nWe believe that the support experience is an extension of the product.

Haison will be investing his time **helping senders like you get the most out of Resend**.\n\n## More about Haison\n\n**How did you get into coding?**\n\nSince I was a child, I have always been passionate about technology. I remember always liking cartoon characters that used some kind of technology, like Batman, Spiderman, and Dexter. After some time, I started to play video games and was very curious about how everything worked. At age 16, I started learning programming logic, and I loved this world so much, so I began to study Java (my first programming love) and then Javascript and Node.\n\n**Why are you at Resend?**\n\nWhen I saw Resend, I was amazed by the quality and potential of the product. It's incredible for me to be part of a team trying to innovate how we deal with emails in software development. I've always wanted to work with products that could somehow change the current technology ecosystem. I see Resend as this opportunity, a chance to really build something that can make a difference in the technology market.\n\n**Where do you find #inspiration?**\n\nI like to be inspired by looking at how other areas outside of technology deal with certain problems; it's amazing how we can gain insights by looking at how other people deal with certain challenges. This leads us to think of simple solutions that bring real value to other people. When the inspiration needs to be a little more artistic, I like to look at some games, especially indie games, that take an artistic look at the world we live in.\n\n**If you weren't helping developers, what would you be doing?**\n\nMaybe I would be trying to be a professional swimmer, as I tried to achieve that goal in my teens, but it's more likely that I would be working in economics, as for a while, I believed that would be my professional field before I fell in love with programming.\n\n**What does your desktop screen look like?**\n\n![Haison's desktop](/static/posts/welcoming-haison-ohara-1.jpg)\n\n**Favorite tool?**\n\nVS Code. I like how we can configure everything and how it can be very different depending on the user. It's incredible because you can see the code how you want, with many plugins that can power the way we solve some tasks.\n\n**Favorite hotkey?**\n\n`Command + F` because this hotkey always helps me to find what I want in the midst of a large amount of information, whether in a code or even in a long article.\n\n**Favorite place to visit?**\n\nChurch. As a Christian, I love spending time in church with my friends and family. It's always a great and revigorating experience.\n\n**Advice for ambitious developers?**\n\nFor everything we want to learn, we need consistency, have an agenda, and systematically organize study and personal development times. But remember, we are human beings, and we need to rest too, spend time with our family, take care of our health, and do anything else that brings us joy.\n"},{"title":"Welcoming Vitor Capretz, our new Software Engineer","slug":"welcoming-vitor-capretz","description":"We're thrilled to share the news that Vitor Capretz is joining Resend.","image":"/static/posts/welcoming-vitor-capretz.jpg","date":"2023-09-07","author_name":"Bu Kinoshita","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/bu-kinoshita.jpg","content":"\nWe're excited to share that Vitor Capretz is joining the Resend team as a Software Engineer!\n\nVitor is a passionate developer who loves building software.

When I applied to college, I initially wanted to build games but quickly learned I enjoyed building software in general, so I decided to go for Computer Science. From there I just spent more and more time building software.\n\n**Why are you at Resend?**\n\nAfter spending a good portion of my career building B2C software I ended up building software for developers and realized how awesome it is and how the industry has many challenges still, email being one of them. When I talked to Zeno and Bu about Resend I realized how much I wanted to be a part of that journey and help build the next generation of communications APIs.\n\n**Where do you find #inspiration?**\n\nI absolutely love reading books about all topics, from fiction to non-fiction, and that helps me think outside of the engineering box.\n\n**If you weren't helping developers, what would you be doing?**\n\nBuilding something. Always building. I just like being able to create something and see people use it and how that helped their lives somehow.\n\n**What does your desktop screen look like?**\n\n![Vitor's desktop](/static/posts/welcoming-vitor-capretz-1.jpg)\n\n**Favorite tool?**\n\nMy iPad, from scratching notes to writing content to just watching videos on the go, has been something I started to appreciate more.\n\n**Favorite hotkey?**\n\n`Command + Space`: It triggers Raycast for me.

Their first step is to see which of these applications can be thrown out without being considered.\n\n[SPF (Sender Policy Framework)](https://www.open-spf.org/) is similar. It's the first triage of the emails coming to an inbox, checking to make sure that each email should even be considered for delivery.\n\nThe DNS record for SPF declares a list of origins (servers) that are allowed to send email for this domain, and the inbox will confirm that the message they received matches one of them. If a server isn't on the list, it's like an application being tossed out because it wasn't fully filled or the business idea is illegal.\n\nEvery domain or subdomain can only have one SPF policy, and policies on the root/apex domain (domain.com) are **not applied to subdomains** (sub.domain.com).\n\nYour SPF policy, specified in a TXT record, probably looks like this:\n\n![Diagram explain SPF record](/static/posts/email-authentication-spf.jpg)\n\n```\nv=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:amazonses.com ~all\n```\n\n- **v=spf1**: The version of SPF\n- **include:\\_spf.google.com**: Allows Google servers to send emails on your domain\n- **include:amazonses.com**: Allows AWS servers to send emails on your domain\n- **~all**: The policy which tells the server what to do if the SPF check fails\n\nWhen a mailbox receives a message from you, it will look at the **Return-Path** in the email header and expects it to map back to one of the origins specified in the record.\n\n## DKIM (Application Vetting)\n\nIf the application passes that initial check, then the vetting process begins to make sure all the claims the applicants made are true.\n\n[DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)](https://dkim.org/) plays a similar role to confirm the legitimacy of the message by adding a signature on each message that verifies the email sender is who they say they are.\n\nDKIM is set with a private/public key pairing.\n\n1. You set a public key in your DNS records (usually a CNAME or TXT record)\n2. Each email you send includes a DKIM signature\n3. When an inbox receives your message, it compares the signature with the public record to confirm a pair\n\nEspecially as your company becomes more well known, there are more incentives for **hackers to send an email as if it is from you**.\n\nThe DKIM, like a strong login password, is an essential way to prove who you are by providing information only you know.\n\nIt is common to have multiple DKIM records, usually one or more per email provider.\n\n## DMARC (Selection Policy)\n\nWhat if an applicant fails one of these steps? How should their application be handled?\n\n[DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \u0026 Conformance)](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/dmarc) is **the selection policy**. It sets rules for what happens if an applicant lies on an application (DKIM) vs. not demonstrate enough traction (SPF). For email, DMARC establishes your policy as a sender for what should happen to your messages if they fail DKIM or SPF.\n\nYou would likely have one DMARC policy set for your entire domain, including subdomains, in a TXT record that looks like this:\n\n![Diagram explain SPF record](/static/posts/email-authentication-dmarc.jpg)\n\n```\nv=DMARC1;p=quarantine;pct=100;rua=mailto:dmarc@domain.com\n```\n\n- **v**: The version of DMARC\n- **p**: What the mailbox should do (policy) if SPF or DKIM fails (none, quarantine, reject)\n- **pct**: The percentage of failed messages that should be affected by the policy.\n- **rua**: A valid inbox where the providers should send their DMARC reports\n\nImplementing DMARC, particularly with a policy of **quarantine** or **reject**, enhances your domain's reputation. This is because inbox providers can rely on your commitment to prevent the delivery of suspicious messages, thereby improving their user experience within the inbox.\n\nCheck out our full guide on [how to set up DMARC](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/dmarc).\n\n## BIMI (Exclusive Access)\n\nMaking it into a startup accelerator is an amazing feat, but if you want to be exceptional, you need to gain the attention of the industry leaders and pioneers. There are no hacks or shortcuts to this, you simply need to prove yourself.\n\n[BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/bimi) is this kind of access in the inbox. It sets you apart from all the others by showcasing your brand and legitimacy to your users in the inbox by displaying your logo and, in some cases, a verified checkmark.\n\nWith over 347 billion emails sent every day, this is an exceptional way to stand out.\n\n![BIMI in the inbox](/static/posts/email-authentication-bimi-inbox.png)\n\nObtaining BIMI is exclusive because of the long, hard process it takes to complete the verification. Here are a few things you need:\n\n- **DMARC**: The DMARC policy must be at quarantine or reject and at 100%\n- **Trademarked Logo**: The logo you want to showcase must be trademarked\n- **VMC**: The certificate which verifies your identity, domain, and trademark\n\n![Diagram explain BIMI record](/static/posts/email-authentication-bimi.jpg)\n\n```\nv=BIMI1; l=https://vmc.digicert.com/00-00.svg; a=https://vmc.digicert.com/00-00.pem;\n```\n\n- **v**: The version of BIMI\n- **l**: The location of the SVG logo\n- **a**: The location of the Verified Mark Certificate (VMC)\n\nCheck out our full guide on [how to set up BIMI](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/bimi).\n\n## Delivery is the Goal\n\nThe good news is that **SPF and DKIM are handled for you when using Resend**. All you need to do is [add a domain](https://resend.com/domains) and we take care of the rest.\n\nUltimately, inbox providers aim to only show the emails their users want to see, and spoofed or compromised emails are not on the list.\n\nWithout these protocols, **they can't tell you from a spammer**.\n\nAssure them you're legit, and they'll prioritize your emails.

This is why we support modern technologies like [React for email building](https://react.email) and [Serverless for sending](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-vercel-edge-functions).\n\nPart of that approach led us to believe all we needed was a great REST API.\n\nHere's a bit of background on why we invested in support of a 40-year-old protocol.\n\n## How we got here\n\nIn 1971, Ray Tomlinson sent the first email using ARPANET. This became one of the foundational building blocks of the internet as we know it.\n\n10 years later, SMTP was born and has persisted as the standard protocol for sending emails for the last 40 years. Thought much of SMTP has been abstracted into various interfaces, it still remains the standard protocol underlying the [347 billion emails sent every day](https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/).\n\n## Why SMTP is so special\n\nOne reason SMTP integrations are still popular today is because they are provider agnostic, allowing the integration point to be based on the protocol rather than a specific email API.\n\nWe noticed quickly that there are still a large amount of systems that rely on SMTP for their integrations. This is true for legacy systems, but also for popular frameworks like [Laravel](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-laravel-smtp), [Rails](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-rails-smtp), [Liferay](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-liferay-smtp), and [Django](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-django-smtp) as well as modern systems like [Retool](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-retool-smtp) and [Supabase](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-supabase-smtp) that want to provide a quick and standardized way for their customers to send emails.\n\n[![Supabase SMTP](/static/posts/smtp-supabase.png)](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-supabase-smtp)\n\nIt was evident that SMTP was not something to avoid, but rather something to embrace.\n\n## Send with SMTP today\n\nToday, we are announcing SMTP with Resend.\n\n[![SMTP on the Dashboard](/static/posts/smtp-dashboard.png)](https://resend.com/settings/smtp)\n\nTo configure an SMTP integration, you can simply use these credentials:\n\n- Host: **smtp.resend.com**\n- Port: **465**\n- Username: **resend**\n- Password: **YOUR_API_KEY**\n\nSee how simple it is to send an email with [SMTP and Nodemailer](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nodemailer-smtp):\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"672\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MM1JE6-inmc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nFor more help with integrating, [check our documentation](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-smtp).\n"},{"title":"Resend raises $3M","description":"Who invested on us.

We've sent over 7 million transactional emails, and we're just getting started.\n\nResend is already quietly powering some of the fastest growing companies. They're building everything from a [platform for artists to tell their story](/customers/layer) to an [investment product with data sourced from Nasdaq and S\u0026P](/customers/fey).\n\nOur open source project, [React Email](https://react.email), just crossed 8,000 stars on GitHub, it has more than 80 contributors, and it's used by teams of all sizes.\n\nToday we're also launching the [Resend Discord](/discord) to connect our community of developers.\n\n[![Resend Discord](/static/posts/resend-raises-3m-a.png)](/discord)\n\n## Our investors\n\nTo help us scale demand, we partnered with **Y Combinator** who funded 90+ billion dollar companies like Stripe, Airbnb, Docker, and many others.\n\nWe're also thrilled to have participation from **SV Angel** who backed world-class companies like GitHub, Slack, and OpenAI.\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \"I'm so excited to be involved with Resend!

Nobody is trying to innovate. There isn’t a single developer-first email platform in the market today. We want to change that.\n\nWe need to stop developing emails like 2010 and rethink how email can be done in 2023 and beyond. Email development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build apps today.\n\nOver the next couple months, we'll double-down on this vision and expand the way you can use Resend to communicate with your users.\n\n## Get started\n\n- Start using Resend today: [resend.com/signup](/signup)\n- Join our community on [Discord](/discord)\n- Make sure to [star us on GitHub](https://github.com/resend/react-email)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/resend)\n"},{"title":"New Free Tier","description":"Now you can send 3,000 emails per month for free.","slug":"new-free-tier","date":"2023-06-12","image":"/static/posts/new-free-tier.jpg","author_name":"Zeno Rocha","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/zeno-rocha.jpg","content":"\nWe have exciting news for small teams and solo developers.\n\nYou can now **send up to 3,000 emails a month (100 per day) on our free plan**.\n\nIf you are currently on the free plan, your account has already been upgraded.\n\n## Why We Did It\n\nAs developers ourselves, we know how important it is to have generous free tiers when you're hacking a side project, mailing your initial batch of users, or exploring new features like magic links.\n\nWe felt like 100 emails a month was not enough, so we **increased it by 30x**.\n\n## What Else Changes\n\nAlong with larger sending quota, we are also adjusting some other limits on the free tier:\n\n**Domains**: Now you can have up to one domain per team. If that isn't enough, all Pro plans will unlock unlimited domains.\n\n**Multi-Region**: We love to see how people are reducing time to inbox with regional sending.

For the past two years, he has been a Design Director at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io).\n\nHis passion for side projects led him to build some fascinating [computational experiments](https://zehfernandes.com/playground) and fully featured products like [Tiblo](https://tiblo.app), [Pliim](https://pliim.app), and [Wordnote](https://wordnote.app).\n\nHere's more about him in his own words.\n\n## More about Zeh\n\n**How did you get into design?**\n\nI lived part of my childhood in the analog world when the magic of computers swept into my life. I was drawn into this magic, spending most of my time exploring, learning, and hacking my way around in this new box. I found joy in creating things and seeing them come to life. As I grew older, this passion for creation led me to study design. It was the perfect blend of creativity, technology, and innovation, enabling me to invent toward my beliefs.\n\n**Why are you at Resend?**\n\nI joined Resend because I was captivated by the team's innovative spirit. We're in a new era of Developer Tools, one where human needs are just as important as the technology supporting them. This presents an opportunity to create meaningful and impactful designs that assist humans in solving their problems at the speed of thought.\n\n**Where do you find #inspiration?**\n\nI believe that great design is the result of diverse influences and multidisciplinary thinking. I am particularly fascinated by the history of computing. The evolution of technology, from the earliest mechanical calculators to today's sophisticated digital systems, is a testament to human ingenuity and innovation. This history inspires me to think creatively about how technology can continue to evolve and better serve our needs.\n\n**If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?**\n\nIf I weren't designing, I would probably be a digital archeologist. I love exploring a topic and understanding the social implication of it. I would love to author books similar to [10print](https://10print.org/), showcasing the remarkable work of others.\n\n**What does your desktop screen look like?**\n\n![Zeh's desktop](/static/posts/welcoming-zeh-fernandes-1.jpg)\n\n**Favorite tool?**\n\nI have a deep appreciation for spreadsheets; they are one of the best end-user software ever created. They empower users to modify the software according to their needs and utilize the human spatial cognition in an effective way.\n\n**Favorite hotkey?**\n\n`Command + D`: This is the command to duplicate in design tools. For me, it signifies that you can explore a different line of thought without losing what you've already created.\n\n**Favorite place to visit?**\n\nI love to go to contemporary museums. See what the emerging artists say about the world we are living in.\n\n**Advice for ambitious designers?**\n\nDesign is about creating solutions for people, so always remember to empathize with the user and learn with them.\n"},{"title":"Launch Week 1: Wrap Up","slug":"launch-week-1-wrap-up","description":"All about the seven new features we launched in the last seven days.","image":"/static/posts/launch-week-1-wrap-up.jpg","date":"2023-03-13","author_name":"Zeno Rocha","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/zeno-rocha.jpg","content":"\nToday marks the end of the first Resend Launch Week.

If you're using Cloudflare, we adapt the UI to match the Cloudflare's UI settings.\n\n![Domain Experience with Cloudflare](/static/posts/new-domain-verification-experience-2.jpg)\n\nOn top of that, we also made the following improvements:\n\n- **Multi-Region Support**: We announced support for two new sending regions. You can now clearly see region when creating or managing your domains.\n- **Per-Record Status**: Sometimes a specific record is having issues. You can now see the verification status of each record so you know where to focus your troubleshooting.\n- **Clear Feedback**: We've added helpful tooltips and documentation links across the various interaction points to give help and clarity as you are verifying your domain.\n\nSee the [new domains page](https://resend.com/domains) for yourself or [request access](https://resend.com) today.\n"},{"title":"Capture email events with Webhooks","slug":"webhooks","description":"Learn how to receive real-time notifications about your email sending activities directly to your server.","image":"/static/posts/webhooks.jpg","date":"2023-03-08","author_name":"Bu Kinoshita","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/bu-kinoshita.jpg","content":"\nWe’re excited to announce one of our most requested features: Webhooks.\n\n## What is a Webhook?\n\nA webhook is a way for one application to provide other applications with real-time information.

There are two types: shared and dedicated.\n\n**Shared IP addresses** are used by multiple domains to send emails and their reputations are shared. If one sender on the shared IP address sends spam, it can negatively affect the reputation of all the other senders on that IP address. However, shared IP addresses are typically more affordable and already “warmed up” by the other domains already sending emails on it.\n\n**Dedicated IP addresses**, on the other hand, are used exclusively by one domain to send emails. This means that the sender has full control over their IP reputation, and their email sending is not impacted by other senders' activities. Dedicated IP addresses are typically more expensive than shared IP addresses, but they offer more control and better deliverability rates for high-volume senders.\n\nFor those that are sending a high-volume and need the reputation control, Resend now offers a Dedicated IP add-on.\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \"Our team loves Resend. It makes email sending so easy and reliable. After we switched to Dedicated IPs, our deliverability improved tremendously and we don't hear complaints about emails landing on spam anymore.\"\n  \u003cdiv class=\"quote-metadata\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"quote-avatars\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"quote-avatar\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Infisical\" src=\"/static/posts/logo-infisical.jpg\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"quote-avatar quote-avatar-author\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Vlad Matsiiako\" src=\"/static/avatars/vlad-matsiiako.jpg\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"quote-author\"\u003e\n      \u003cspan class=\"quote-author-name\"\u003eVlad Matsiiako\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003cspan class=\"quote-author-job\"\u003eCo-founder of Infisical\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n## The Benefits of Dedicated IPs\n\nNow, let's dive into the benefits of dedicated IPs.\n\n**1. Increased Deliverability**\n\nWith dedicated IPs, you have more control over your sender reputation. When you share an IP with other companies, their actions can negatively impact your deliverability. By using a dedicated IP, you reduce the risk of your emails going to spam due to someone else's actions.\n\n**2. Improved Sender Reputation**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, dedicated IPs give you complete control over your sender reputation. You can send emails at your own pace, control all inputs into your sender reputation, and ensure that all emails coming from your IP complies with industry standards. All of these factors contribute to building a strong sender reputation, which is critical for email deliverability.\n\n**3. Increased Security**\n\nWith a dedicated IP address, you have full control over your email sending activities and can ensure that your emails are not being mixed with other senders' emails. This provides full isolation down to the server level.\n\n## The Big Drawback (IP Warming)\n\nUsually when you purchase a dedicated IP you are required to follow a process called “IP warming” which is a multi-week process of incrementally sending more emails each day until the new IP address is warmed up, which can take weeks to months. This is because your new IP address has no reputation and if you start sending thousands are millions of emails, many inbox providers may flag your IP as concerning because its unknown.\n\nWe don’t think this experience is very pleasant, so we provide **Managed Dedicated IP** pools. We handle all the IP warming in the background so when you receive your dedicated IP from Resend, you can immediately start sending at scale.\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \"I've used Mailgun, Sendgrid, and Mandrill and they don't come close to providing the quality of developer experience you get with Resend.\"\n  \u003cdiv class=\"quote-metadata\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"quote-avatars\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"quote-avatar\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Outerbase\" src=\"/static/posts/logo-outerbase.jpg\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"quote-avatar quote-avatar-author\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Brandon Strittmatter\" src=\"/static/avatars/brandon-strittmatter.jpg\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"quote-author\"\u003e\n      \u003cspan class=\"quote-author-name\"\u003eBrandon Strittmatter\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003cspan class=\"quote-author-job\"\u003eCo-founder of Outerbase\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n## Deliverability for All\n\nYou may be thinking: _“I’m not a high-volume sender but I still want incredible deliverability”_.\n\nThe good news is that though dedicated IP’s are a powerful piece of the deliverability puzzle for high-volume cases, any user can achieve the legendary deliverability on our shared IP’s.\n\nMany senders find their deliverability improves more from Resend’s high-quality shared traffic than from the isolating of a dedicated IP.\n\nBoth shared and dedicated IPs get our full deliverability attention. This means aggressive measures to protect from spamming, bouncing, and malicious actors, but also white-glove support from our team to enable you towards best practices.\n\n## Get Your Own IP\n\nWant to get started with a dedicated IP for your domain?\n\nYou can [request it as an add-on on your account](https://resend.com/settings) today.\n"},{"title":"Faster Email Delivery with Multi-Region","slug":"multi-region","description":"We're excited to announce support for multi-region email sending.","image":"/static/posts/multi-region.jpg","date":"2023-03-06","author_name":"Zeno Rocha","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/zeno-rocha.jpg","content":"\nNow, users have the option to send transactional emails from three different regions:\n\n- **Europe (Ireland)**\n- **South America (Brazil)**\n- **East US (North Virginia)**\n\nThis means that no matter where your users are, you can ensure that they receive your emails in a timely and efficient manner.\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \"All of our customers are located in South America, so having a solution that could send emails from the region closest to our users is very important.

Hopefully, this will help other founders who are launching their own waitlists or looking to find potential users.\n\n![Waitlist growth](/static/posts/lessons-learned-from-growing-a-waitlist-1.jpg)\n\n## What went well\n\n**1. Landing page**\n\nWe knew that we were entering a space with many consolidated competitors, so it was crucial to show people that we were different. We did that by creating a landing page that was extremely simple but also had unique branding and smooth interactions.\n\n![Resend.com](/static/posts/lessons-learned-from-growing-a-waitlist-2.jpg)\n\nHere's what worked for us:\n\n- **Tip #1 - Show personality** - Adding an animated WebGL object was super important for me. Some people might say it's a distraction, but without saying a word, it communicates that we care about the technical details. Also, the Rubik's cube is the perfect analogy to what we were doing. It's an old thing that people are familiar with, but it's displayed in a new way. The same goes for Resend. We're doing something that people are familiar with (sending emails), but we're doing it in a modern way (using React).\n- **Tip #2 - Know your audience** - As a developer, I absolutely love keyboard shortcuts. I couldn't live without them, and I'm sure many other developers feel the same way. Even though a landing page is not a place to add keyboard shortcuts, it was a great way to show that we care about the same things our audience cares about.\n- **Tip #3 - Focus on the details** - Most landing pages we visit nowadays follow the same pattern. They use a predefined template that looks like every other landing page. As you start navigating, you might find typos or broken links. I truly believe that the small details make a big difference. If you don't communicate that you care about your own website, then why should someone else care?\n\n**2. Social media posts**\n\nBack in 2009, I created an account on this new social media website called Twitter. There were a few months when I was posting every day, and there were a few months when I wasn't posting at all. I didn't have a strategy, I was just sharing whatever I was working on. After years of doing that, I built a following of 39.4k people. This came in handy when we were launching Resend.\n\nOn January 4th, 2023 at 7:11 am PT, I published the [first tweet about Resend](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1610655123063336961). This tweet had 999.3k views, 4,634 likes, 352 retweets, and 282 replies. I'm not a big LinkedIn user, but I did [post the same content there](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zenorocha_personal-update-im-leaving-my-job-to-start-activity-7016420524977209344-qrUI), and it got 107,411 views, 1,378 likes, and 156 comments.\n\n![Tweet about Resend](/static/posts/lessons-learned-from-growing-a-waitlist-3.jpg)\n\nHere's some tactical advice I learned from this experience:\n\n- **Tip #4 - Post a video** - from all the possible content formats, video is the one that performs best nowadays. If you can't do video, then use an image. Plain text and links perform worst in my experience.\n- **Tip #5 - Post early in the day** - when doing a big launch, be aware of the best time to post. I chose 7 am PT because that's when people from California wake up and check their phones, it's still early on the East Coast, and people from Europe have not ended their work day yet.\n- **Tip #6 - Post during the week** - I also chose a weekday because people are more likely to be at work and have time to check their social media. In my opinion, Monday isn't a good day to launch because people are getting ready for the week. Friday is also not a good day because people are already thinking about the weekend. That's why we posted on Wednesday.\n\nIf you're not into social media, that's totally fine. There are many founders who don't engage on social platforms and still build incredible companies. However, if you're thinking about starting a profile, keep this in mind - the best time to start posting was yesterday, the second best time is today.\n\n**3. Build in public**\n\nAfter the initial launch, it's important that you keep bringing new people to the waitlist. We did that by sharing our progress publicly.\n\n- **Tip #7 - Keep the momentum** - in order to keep people from the waitlist engaged, we started sending them emails about [company news](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1620809395310583808) and [product updates](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1618633776212631554). This was a great way to keep people interested in what we were doing.\n- **Tip #8 - Be personal** - one of the things that I learned with YC is that being vulnerable is not a demonstration of weakness. Being vulnerable shows that you're a human being too. People act like they know everything. In reality, we're all just trying to figure it out. So don't be afraid of [showing the behind-the-scenes](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1612263110370549760).\n- **Tip #9 - Build with others** - as you start to share your journey, you'll start to get more people interested in what you're doing. Some of them might want to help you. In our case, that meant other companies building [integrations with our product](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1621204586500591619). We also tried to respond to every single person who engaged with our content.\n\n![Email about Resend](/static/posts/lessons-learned-from-growing-a-waitlist-4.jpg)\n\n## What went wrong\n\n**1. Performance testing**\n\nOn the day we launched, we got several complaints about performance issues ([1](https://twitter.com/matloyed/status/1610715639576170496), [2](https://twitter.com/BarzolaGabriel/status/1610677004231131141), [3](https://twitter.com/steren/status/1610757385429319680), [4](https://twitter.com/bernatfortet/status/1611030644301365250), [5](https://twitter.com/jonatasvsalles/status/1610664703516090371)). We knew that people were going to sign up on mobile, but we didn't spend too much time testing the performance on real phones.\n\n![\"Slowest landing page I have seen in 2023\" Tweet](/static/posts/lessons-learned-from-growing-a-waitlist-5.jpg)\n\nDealing with performance issues in the middle of a launch is not fun. Small bugs can be dealt right away, but performance improvements typically require deep thinking and a lot of debugging. We ended up fixing all of them, but I wished we had done that before the launch.\n\n**2. Email address validation**\n\nWhen setting up the waitlist form, we wanted to have something that was easy to use and low friction. There was only a simple input field, and we didn't want to ask people to confirm their email address. Even though we had some back-end validation, people could still add fake email addresses.\n\n![Resend Request Access screen](/static/posts/lessons-learned-from-growing-a-waitlist-6.jpg)\n\nIn order to address this, we integrated an email validation service called [Emailable](https://emailable.com) to guarantee that the email addresses were real. If we had better validation from day one, we would have saved a lot of time.\n\n**3. Processing the waitlist**\n\nIn the beginning, we didn't have a proper plan to process the waitlist. We found ourselves with a big list of email address and no idea how to prioritize them. What worked for us was building a quick Typeform to understand who were the best people to onboard first.\n\nWe initially required every prospect to go through a mandatory onboarding call first (Superhuman style), but we quickly realized that wouldn't scale with our current team size, so we changed it to automatically onboard certain user segments.\n\n![Resend Typeform](/static/posts/lessons-learned-from-growing-a-waitlist-7.jpg)\n\nIt's important that you qualify your leads before reaching out to them. If you don't, you'll end up wasting a lot of time with the wrong customer profile.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA waitlist is a great way to build a community around your product. It's also a great way to get feedback from people who are interested in what you're building.\n\nYou will never be 100% ready to launch, and that's okay. There will always be something that you can improve or fix. The best thing you can do is to launch and iterate.\n\nIf you're not launching, you're not learning.\n"},{"title":"Why I spent $25,000 on a domain (or how to pick a startup name)","slug":"how-to-pick-a-startup-name","description":"Thoughts on the importance of choosing a strong brand name, challenges of finding an available domain, and tips on how to better negotiate and acquire a domain.","image":"/static/posts/how-to-pick-a-startup-name.jpg","date":"2023-02-06","author_name":"Zeno Rocha","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/zeno-rocha.jpg","content":"\nWhenever I talk to other YC founders in my batch, the number one question I get is:\n\n\u003e \"How did you get the [resend.com](https://resend.com) domain?\"\n\nInstead of repeating myself, I decided to write this post with two goals in mind:\n\n1. Answer this question in a written format so that I can send a link to whoever asks me that again;\n2. Help other founders struggling to find a good name for their startup.\n\n## Picking any name to start\n\nWhen we began discussing the idea of starting this, we decided we wouldn't spend even 1 minute thinking about naming in the beginning.\n\nWe wanted to focus on building the product and nothing else, so we got a domain that combined our first names. My name is Zeno, and my co-founder's name is Bu, so we bought [zeebbu.com](https://zeebbu.com).\n\nI know, I know, terrible name! But it didn't matter. At that point, we were building a prototype and just needed a URL to deploy and test.\n\n## Validating the idea\n\nAs the MVP evolved, we realized we needed a better name before sending the link to people.\n\nWe were looking for a domain that was free and a little bit easier to type, so we bought [klotty.com](https://klotty.com). We knew that was still a very bad name and definitely not the final one, but it was good enough to start putting it in the hands of early adopters.\n\nOne day we applied to [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/resend) and got accepted (a crazy story for another day).\n\nSo now it was time to go all in. We wanted a strong name, a name that would send a message, a name that could communicate that we were serious about this company idea.\n\n## Having an idea generation framework\n\nWe started by brainstorming a list of words that we thought were cool, and then we combined them in different ways. Here are some of the methods we used:\n\n1. Put two random words together:\n\n```\ntail-wind, planet-scale, up-stash, super-human\n```\n\n2. Combine niche-specific words:\n\n```\ngit-hub, drop-box, fire-base, mail-gun\n```\n\n3. Drop the last vowel:\n\n```\nflickr, tumblr, grindr, scribd, checkr\n```\n\n4. Pick dictionary word:\n\n```\nlinear, stripe, convoy, notion\n```\n\n5. Invent a word:\n\n```\nbrex, google, kodak, sony\n```\n\n6. Add another letter:\n\n```\ndribbble, fiverr, groww\n```\n\nAt this point, we had a list of dozens of names, but how do you know which one is the best?\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/how-to-pick-a-startup-name-1.jpg\" alt=\"Notion page with some initial name ideas\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eNotion page with some initial name ideas\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n## Establishing some guidelines for yourself\n\nWe had to narrow down the options somehow, that's why we came up with a system to filter the name ideas and make the decision easier. This was our list of must-haves:\n\n1. **Global** - it needs to be a .com TLD, no exceptions;\n2. **Short** - it has to be less than 10 characters, no more than that;\n3. **Memorable** - it needs to be connected to the product in some way;\n4. **Easy to type** - you can type it on your phone without asking others to spell the name;\n5. **Easy to pronounce** - you can tell someone in a bar with loud music in the background, and people can still understand it;\n\nAnother good idea is to set a timebox for making this decision. It's easy to go down the rabbit hole and spend months thinking about the perfect name. You need to set a deadline and stick to it.\n\n## Checking what's available\n\nOnce you have a list of names, you need to check if they are available. We did this manually by checking the [whois](https://whois.com) records and trying to find the owner. Nowadays, with all the privacy laws, it's much harder to find contact information online, so you need to get creative and look for clues.\n\nOne thing I like to do is check the source code of the website or look for [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) snapshots to see if there's anything that could help track the owner.\n\nFor this part, you have to be prepared to be disappointed. Many people won't return your emails, and you'll have to move on to the next name.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/how-to-pick-a-startup-name-2.jpg\" alt=\"Outreach database to keep track of who responded or not\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eOutreach database to keep track of who responded or not\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n## Understanding the prices\n\nOnce you finally get a reply from the domain owner, it's time to start cataloging the initial prices.\n\nIt's important that you open multiple negotiations at the same time, so you can compare prices and better understand the market.\n\nSome numbers are just too high, and there's nothing you can do about it. However, you can get a good deal if you play your cards right.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/how-to-pick-a-startup-name-3.jpg\" alt=\"List of available domains and their prices\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eList of available domains and their prices\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n## Negotiating and closing the deal\n\nI'm not going to lie, this is the hardest part. You need to be persistent, and you need to be prepared to walk away at any moment.\n\nWhen I first saw the asking price for [resend.com](https://resend.com) I was in shock. No way I'd pay $39,999 for a domain.\n\nStill, this was a 6-letter dictionary word domain, so it was worth digging deeper.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/how-to-pick-a-startup-name-4.jpg\" alt=\"Asking price: $39,999\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eAsking price: $39,999\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nI replied to the email with a lowball offer of $7,999 and waited for a response.\n\nFor sure I was going to get a rejection, but this was a test to see if they were willing to negotiate or not.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/how-to-pick-a-startup-name-5.jpg\" alt=\"Initial counteroffer: $7,999\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eInitial counteroffer: $7,999\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nThey sent a counteroffer of $35,000, and we started negotiating.\n\nAfter a few of days of back and forth, we settled on $25,000.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/posts/how-to-pick-a-startup-name-6.jpg\" alt=\"Deal closed for $25,000\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eDeal closed for $25,000\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nI can't tell you how happy I was when they finally transferred the domain.\n\nIt was a long and painful process, but it was worth it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's easy to think that a good name is the key to success, but that's not true. You can have the best name in the world, but if you don't have a good product, you won't get anywhere.\n\nPaul Graham once wrote an essay called [Change Your Name](http://www.paulgraham.com/name.html), and he said:\n\n\u003e If you have a US startup called X and you don't have x.com, you should probably change your name.\n\nOf course, every rule has exceptions. Just look at [notion.so](https://notion.so) and [linear.app](https://linear.app). These companies are winning not because of their domains but because of their amazing products.\n\nThe ultimate value of a domain name depends on how well it is utilized.\n"},{"title":"Resend + Y Combinator","slug":"y-combinator","description":"We're excited to announce that Resend is now backed by Y Combinator.","image":"/static/posts/y-combinator.jpg","date":"2023-02-01","author_name":"Zeno Rocha","author_avatar":"/static/avatars/zeno-rocha.jpg","content":"\nOur goal is to reimagine how email can be done in 2023 and beyond.

Nobody is trying to innovate.\n\nThere isn’t a single developer-first email platform in the market today. We want to change that.\n\nWe need to stop developing emails like 2010 and rethink how email can be done in 2023 and beyond.\n\nEmail development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build apps today.\n\n## Join us\n\nI'm really excited to take on the role of founder \u0026 CEO and to create an elite team of builders.\n\nWe're creating something special here, and I can't wait to share it with you.\n\nJoin the waitlist and you'll be the first to try it out: [resend.com](https://resend.com).\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog","query":{},"buildId":"XSe6_RzH2FbEfcRaaL7by","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
